Capabilities
============
finitediff currently provides callbacks for evaluation at single point and over an array


Installation
============
Example using pip (modify to your own needs):

    1. ``pip install --user --upgrade -r https://raw.github.com/bjodah/finitediff/master/requirements.txt``
    2. ``pip install --user --upgrade https://github.com/bjodah/finitediff/archive/v0.1.4.tar.gz``

Manual installation:
    1. Clone repository ``git clone https://github.com/bjodah/finitediff.git``
    2. Install dependencies ``cd finitediff; pip install --user --upgrade -r requirements.txt``
    3. To install run ``python setup.py install --user`` or ``sudo python setup.py install``.

See distutils' documentation_ for more options.
.. _documentation: http://docs.python.org/2/library/distutils.html

Note that the behaviour of ``setup(...)`` is modified slightly through the use of "CleverExtension" from pycompilation.
